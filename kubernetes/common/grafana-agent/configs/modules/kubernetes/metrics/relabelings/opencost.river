	// opencost typically expects the following labels to be present:
	// - exported_namespace
	// - exported_instance
	// - exported_pod
	// - exported_container
	//
	// to be present, the exported_ is a prefix added when there are label collisions, meaning the metrics returned
	// have labels that already exist.  This all works, except for container, if using Service Discovery endpoint/pod
	// and the pod has multiple containers that expose ports this can result in potentially duplicate scrape jobs,
	// which would lead to duplicate metrics.  The configuration is to typically not keep a "container" label, as it
	// can cause duplicate scrapes and incorrect metric calculations for instances where a pod has multiple containers
	// and multiple ports even if a single port should be scraped.  However, for opencost dashboards/rules to work correctly,
	// this should be added, since it is not auto-generated and the container label returned from opencost is just "container"
	// we need to copy it

	// due to the fact it is easier to perform a keep and maintain a whitelist, we have to take a
	// multi-step approach since the metrics could be coming from any job, not just opencost:
	//
	// 1st apply a keep regex, changing the name of the metric to be preceded by __
	// 2nd drop anything matching opencost where the metric name starts with a alpha character
	// 3rd remove the temp __ added in the 1st step

	// add temp __ to metrics we want to keep
