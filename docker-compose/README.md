# Docker Compose Deployment modes

You can deploy in one of three modes

- [Monolithic mode](./monolithic-mode)
- [Read-Write mode](./read-write-mode)
- [Microservices mode](./microservices-mode)

## Monolithic mode (单体模式)

The monolithic mode runs all required components in a single process.

## Read-Write mode (读写模式)

The read-write mode provides an alternative to monolithic and microservices modes.

## Microservices mode (微服务模式)

In microservices mode, components are deployed in distinct processes.
